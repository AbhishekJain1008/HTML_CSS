          Sports are organized physical activities or games that involve
          physical effort, skill, and strategic thinking. They are played for
          entertainment, competition, fitness, and personal development. Sports
          can be played individually or in teams and are governed by a set of
          rules and regulations to ensure fair play. From ancient times to the
          modern era, sports have been an important part of human culture. They
          bring people together, promote unity, and encourage a healthy
          lifestyle. Whether played professionally or recreationally, sports
          help individuals develop discipline, confidence, and perseverance.
